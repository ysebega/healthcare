This is project is about the diabetes dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIKDD). The dataset has 9 features and 768 observations. The outcome field of 1s and 0s make it a binary classification. Binary in terms of classifying a patient as having diabetes and not.
The dataset has many missing values inputted as 0. Data imputation was also done in order to keep some observations. We have done mean imputation for BloodPressure and SkinThickness. As for the Insulin feature, the median was more representative statistically for imputation.
The project was completed using Jupyter Notebook. The last point (dashboard) was done using Tableau Public. Codes in Jupyter Notebook were well-documented, and some are self-explanatory.
The analysis and interpretation of the results are done within the notebook.
We consider unnecessary to repeat the code or analysis or interpretation in this write-up.
